# Bank-App-GUI
Added a new line for test

## Ideas To Implement
1. Bank Class (Manages Accounts)
Steps:
    Create a Bank class.
    Add a collection (e.g., ArrayList<Account>) to store accounts.
    Add methods: addAccount, removeAccount, findAccountByNumber, listAccounts.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    class Bank {
        List<Account> accounts;

        void addAccount(Account acc) { ... }
        void removeAccount(String accNum) { ... }
        Account findAccountByNumber(String accNum) { ... }
        List<Account> listAccounts() { ... }
    }
    ```

2. BankManager Class (Admin User)
Steps:
    Create a BankManager class.
    Add methods for manager actions (e.g., view all accounts, approve loans).
    Optionally, create a manager GUI.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    class BankManager {
        Bank bank;

        void viewAllAccounts() { ... }
        void approveLoan(Loan loan) { ... }
    }
    ```

3. Customer Class (Represents a User)
Steps:
    Create a Customer class.
    Store customer info and a list of their accounts.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    class Customer {
        String name;
        List<Account> accounts;
    }
    ```

4. Transfer Functionality
Steps:
    Add a transfer method in Bank or Account.
    Update balances and transaction histories for both accounts.
    Add a transfer button/dialog in the GUI.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    void transfer(Account from, Account to, double amount) {
        if (from.balance >= amount) {
            from.withdraw(amount);
            to.deposit(amount);
        }
    }
    ```

5. Loan Management
Steps:
    Create a Loan class.
    Add methods to apply for, approve, and repay loans.
    Add GUI for loan management.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    class Loan {
        double amount;
        double interestRate;
        boolean approved;
    }

    void applyForLoan(Customer c, double amount) { ... }
    void approveLoan(Loan loan) { ... }
    void repayLoan(Loan loan, double payment) { ... }
    ```

6. Interest Calculation
Steps:
    Add an applyInterest method in Account or Bank.
    Periodically call this method (e.g., with a timer).
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    void applyInterest(Account acc, double rate) {
        acc.balance += acc.balance * rate;
    }
    ```

7. Transaction Class
Steps:
    Create a Transaction class (type, amount, date, description).
    Store transactions in Account as List<Transaction>.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    class Transaction {
        String type;
        double amount;
        Date date;
        String description;
    }
    ```

8. Reports and Statements
Steps:
    Add a method to generate statements from transaction history.
    Optionally, export to CSV or PDF.
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    String generateStatement(Account acc) {
        // Loop through transactions and format as string
    }
    ```

9. Improved GUI
Steps:
    Use JTabbedPane for different features.
    Add panels for accounts, transfers, loans, etc.
    Improve error messages and feedback.

10. Notifications
Steps:
    Add a notification system (e.g., popups, logs).
    Trigger notifications for events (low balance, large withdrawal).
Pseudocode:
    ```java
    void notifyUser(String message) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, message);
    }
    ```
